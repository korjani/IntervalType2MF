A New Method for Calibrating the Fuzzy Sets Used in fsQCA

A number of methods have been published on how to map data collected from a group of subjects into the FOU of a word. The Interval Approach (IA) was the first such method; it was followed by the Enhanced Interval Approach (EIA) , which makes use of more information from the collected data than does the IA. More recently, the HM Approach (HMA) was developed; it makes use of even more information from the collected data than does the EIA. 

The IA, EIA and HMA were all initially developed assuming that data can be collected from a group of subjects, and that such a group is available. Sometimes such a group is not available and only one knowledgeable expert is available, e.g. Prof. Ragin or any other fsQCA scholar. Mendel and Wu [31] have presented a different way to collect data from one person, after which that data can be used to generate even more data for what might be called a “virtual group of subjects.” The HMA is then directly applied to that larger set of data.
